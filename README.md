# Machine Learning Foundations
## Basics of Machine Learning with relevant notebook examples
This repository tries to encompass basics of all the major machine learning techniques so that anyone
can start their machine learning journey with a steep learning curve.

This repo starts with Data Preprocessing techniques, delves into Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
techniques and then into Deep Learning. Deep Learning for NLP and Computer Vision will be covered
along with Deep Reinforcement Learning. Quantum Machine Learning techniques are also planned to be
added, but currently it is an overkill for me.

Initially, the focus will be on basic examples of all the relevant machine learning techniques. Focus
will be on covering the intuition behind each technique using simple datasets.

Python will be used extensively (Python 3) and all the major machine learning libraries and tools
will be covered (including but not limited to numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy,
tensorflow etc.). Currently, Google Colaboratory is used as our Notebook Environment since our target
is to start applying what we are learning right there itself without the need to download or install
anything. Everything is taken cared by Google (every library including tensorflow are pre-installed)
and we can take advantage of the free GPUs for Deep Learning.
