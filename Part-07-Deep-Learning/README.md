## Part 07 Deep Learning

Deep Learning models mimic neural networks inside human brain to solve complex machine learning
problems. It is a subset of Machine Learning. Even though Research in Deep Learning dates back to
1980s, it was not feasible at that time due to technology immaturity. With the exponential increase
in storage capacity and processing capacity of computers, it has now become possible to train and
deploy complex neural networks able to solve challenging problems in Machine Learning.

In this part, we will learn how to implement the following Deep Learning models:

1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
4. Self Organizing Maps (SOMs)
5. Boltzmann Machines
6. Auto Encoders

We will also discuss how to evaluate performance of our Deep Learning Models and improve them.
