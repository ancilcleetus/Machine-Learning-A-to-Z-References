# Part 02 Regression

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a continuous real value, like
salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values.
Otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values.

In this part, we will learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models:

1- Simple Linear Regression
2- Multiple Linear Regression
3- Polynomial Linear Regression
4- Support Vector Regression
5- Decision Tree Regression
6- Random Forest Regression

We will also discuss how to evaluate performance of our Regression Models and find the best Regression
Model suited to our dataset.
